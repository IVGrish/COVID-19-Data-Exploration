# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis & Visualization
This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project exploring the global impact of COVID-19 using SQL and Tableau. It covers data wrangling, key metrics calculation and visualization of trends related to cases, deaths and vaccinations.

##### SQL Analysis (Microsoft SQL Server)
The SQL script performs detailed analysis using data from the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations datasets. Key tasks include:
  * Trend Analysis: New cases and deaths over time.
  * Mortality Rate: Likelihood of dying from COVID based on total cases and deaths.
  * Infection Rate: Percent of population infected in each country.
  * Vaccination Tracking: Cumulative vaccinations per country over time.
  * Aggregations: Using CTEs, temp tables and views for structured insights.

##### Tableau Dashboard
The interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes insights derived from the data:
  * Geospatial Mapping (ZIP codes or countries).
  * Bar and Line Charts for trend and categorical analysis.
  * Interactive Filters for exploring by region or metric.<br><br>
